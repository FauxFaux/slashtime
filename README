This is slashtime, a small program which displays the time in various places.


COMPILING AND RUNNING
=====================

To build this example, do the following:

	$ ./configure
	$ make

The configure script will find the pre-requisites and select an appropriate
java compiler. Make will then build both Java bytecode and a native executable.
To run, do

	$ ./slashtime-java

or if you build a GCJ executable version, run

	$ ./slashtime-native

Tip: its not quite yet packaged properly for generic installation. But if you
do this from your shell prompt:

	$ ( cd ~/src/whatever/slashtime ; ./slashtime-java & )

it'll background safely.


HISTORY
=======

Circa 2002, a Debian package called gworldclock came with a short shell script
called tzwatch which somewhat mimicked its output. Both programs were
reasonable enough, but like most timezone things, they displayed the offset
from GMT. I've always found that a little useless.  Telling me that I am in
GMT+11 and someone I want to talk to is shown in GMT-4 still doesn't help me
get an intuitive grasp of what the differential is.

So Andrew Cowie wrote a small perl script called slashtime.  Named after the
short cut on his employer's company website that gets you to an HTML version,
operationaldynamics.com/time, it started out life as a perl script, and gained
a bit of a cult following from people who would put it into their
.bash_profiles to run when launching a terminal.

Meanwhile, GNOME has long shipped a clock applet. This clock applet is fine
enough, and pops a calendar when you click on it. Sometime in 2006, Andrew got
the idea to write a GUI version of slashtime.


FAQ
===

What's with the white, gray, and black?
---------------------------------------

White: business hours
Gray: civil hours (it is still "civilized" to call someone at that hour)
Black: night time

What's with the day rolling over at 01:30?
------------------------------------------

Simple: that's when hackers go to bed! So black at the bottom means that
someone hard core may still be reachable online if they're up working, whereas
black on top really means they're asleep.


STATUS
======

Lots to do yet. Basic program works. No customizing zones or such yet. Meeting
functionality works well (try Ctrl+M). Still needs lots of love in
documentation, installing to a DESTDIR, etc.

And it's not an applet yet since java-gnome 2.x doesn't have an applet binding.
The 4.0 Java bindings most certainly will, assuming someone steps up and funds
the re-engineering project.

A guide to hacking on slashtime:

RETRIEVING THE SOURCE CODE
--------------------------

	$ bzr init-repo slashtime
	$ cd slashtime
	$ bzr checkout http://research.operationaldynamics.com/bzr/slashtime/mainline
	$ bzr branch mainline working
	$ cd working
	$ ./configure
	$ make

Now try

	$ ./slashtime


RUNNING IN ECLIPSE
------------------

One of the significant reasons to ensure that the program still builds and runs
with a conventional Java VM is so that it can be worked on in Eclipse. The
build system, equivalence, is designed with this in mind.


CONTRIBUTING
------------

We would welcome contributions back. If you'd like to do so, please follow the
code formatting conventions you see, or use something like Eclipse to
autoformat things.

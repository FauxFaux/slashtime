TODO file for slashtime. Roughly ordered by priority, but most
importantly, this is a scratch pad so we don't loose current ideas.

	- Sort out accelerators :(

src/com/operationaldynamics/slashtime/ZonesWindow.java

	- wouldn't it be cool that if you dragged a zone up or down that
	  the list of visible zones would loop round so that zones that
	  were at top would now be listed at bottom, etc, whilst the
	  offset of zones further away than 16(?) would display in 1-x
	  terms, ie -20 would show as -20 (+4)? It would mean having to use
	  a different discriminator to order, adjusting as we rolled.

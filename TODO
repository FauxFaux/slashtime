TODO file for slashtime. Roughly ordered by priority, but most
importantly, this is a scratch pad so we don't loose current ideas.


configure

	- detection of javah needs to be in its own category, and needs to
	  actually test that it works satisfactorily. This will need a more
	  elaborate native/JNI test case.

	- context menu: add new zone (to dialog), delete
	  this zone (to confirm dialog)

	- wouldn't it be cool that if you dragged a zone up or down that
	  the list of visible zones would loop round so that zones that
	  were at top would now be listed at bottome, etc, whilst the
	  offset of zones further away than 16(?) would display in 1-x
	  terms, ie -20 would show as -20 (+4)? It would mean having to use
	  a different discriminator to order, adjusting as we rolled.
